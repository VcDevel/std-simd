# `std::experimental::simd`
portable, zero-overhead C++ types for explicitly data-parallel programming

This package implements ISO/IEC TS 19570:2018 Section 9 "Data-Parallel Types".
Development here has stopped after it has been included in [GCC/libstdc++](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/experimental/simd;hb=HEAD) since version 11.
The implementation derived from https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc.

By default, the `install.sh` script places the `std::experimental::simd`
headers into the directory where the standard library of your C++ compiler
(identified via `$CXX`) resides.

It is only tested and supported with GCC 11, even though it may (partially) work
with older GCC versions.

## Target support

* x86_64 is the main development platform and thoroughly tested. This includes
  support from SSE-only up to AVX512 on Xeon Phi or Xeon CPUs.
* aarch64, arm, and ppc64le was tested and verified to work. No significant 
  performance evaluation was done. Sve2 instructions are in development.
* In any case, a fallback to correct execution via builtin arthmetic types is
  available for all targets.

## Installation Instructions

```sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Use `--help` to learn about the available options.

## Example

### Scalar Product

Let's start from the code for calculating a 3D scalar product using builtin floats:
```cpp
using Vec3D = std::array<float, 3>;
float scalar_product(Vec3D a, Vec3D b) {
  return a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + a[2] * b[2];
}
```

Using `simd`, we can easily vectorize the code using the `native_simd<float>` 
type ([Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/AXAe8K)):
```cpp
using std::experimental::native_simd;
using Vec3D = std::array<native_simd<float>, 3>;
native_simd<float> scalar_product(Vec3D a, Vec3D b) {
  return a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + a[2] * b[2];
}
```

The above will scale to 1, 4, 8, 16, etc. scalar products calculated in parallel, depending
on the target hardware's capabilities.

For comparison, the same vectorization using Intel SSE intrinsics is more verbose, uses
prefix notation (i.e. function calls), and neither scales to AVX or AVX512, nor is it
portable to different SIMD ISAs:
```cpp
using Vec3D = std::array<__m128, 3>;
__m128 scalar_product(Vec3D a, Vec3D b) {
  return _mm_add_ps(_mm_add_ps(_mm_mul_ps(a[0], b[0]), _mm_mul_ps(a[1], b[1])),
                    _mm_mul_ps(a[2], b[2]));
}
```

## Build Requirements

none. It's header-only.

However, to build the unit tests you will need:
* cmake >= 3.0
* GCC >= 9.1

To execute all AVX512 unit tests, you will need the Intel SDE.

## Building the tests

```sh
$ make test
```

This will create a build directory, run cmake, compile the tests, and execute the tests.
